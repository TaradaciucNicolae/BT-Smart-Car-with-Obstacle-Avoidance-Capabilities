# Bluetooth controlled smart car with obstacle avoiding capabilities

This Arduino-based smart car, programmed in C++, features Bluetooth control via a PS5 controller for seamless operation and an obstacle
avoidance mode, where the car autonomously navigates its environment, avoiding obstacles in real-time. 

The ATmega328P microcontroller was
programmed to facilitate continuous communication between the PS5 controller,
USB Host Shield, and the car's motor control system.
